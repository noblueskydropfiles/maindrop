	<p>Welcome to my personnal repo for hosting various code files ! (no pictures or very small ones only like buttons)</p>
	<p>Not much to see there ^_^</p>
	<p>If you're a MAL user, why not considering to make your own Github pages ? It's easy !</p>
	<p>Get a Github account, make a repo, clone with desktop app, add files (index.html required), then set master branch to github pages in repo page settings, and you're online on username.github.io (works even with https://) !</p>
